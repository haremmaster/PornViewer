# PornViewer
An image viewer for mission-critical applications. Designed to provide a pleasurable viewing
experience. Theoretically cross-platform, currently available on Windows.


## Installation
Use one of these installer links below. If you like it, please [help me not be so broke](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=PN6C2AZTS2FP8&lc=US&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted).

### Windows Installers
#### 64 bits
 * [0.0.1](https://github.com/shenanigans/PornViewer/releases/download/0.0.1/PornViewer_x64.msi)
 
#### 32 bits
The startup time is slightly slower than the x64 version, but I'm working on it.
 * [0.0.1](https://github.com/shenanigans/PornViewer/releases/download/0.0.1/PornViewer_x86.msi)

### Linux Binaries
I've been having a problem with the `lwip` module, it's supposed to statically bind its own libpng
but it still somehow gets confused by the older version dynamically bound by node-webkit. Probably I
need to build my own node-webkit with libpng bound statically. If anybody has some thoughts on this
I'd love to hear them.

### OSX
Somebody with one of those dumbass apple computers is welcome to figure out a build for them. Mine
bricked out when its stupid battery died. And hey seriously isn't that `.dmg` thing weird as an
install process? Drag this shit into here. Random scripts go off unexpectedly. That's the sleak,
intuitive way to install things. See the [build instructions](#building-pornviewer) near the bottom
if you're thinking of helping out, you communist filth.


## FAQ
Actually that's a lie. Nobody has ever asked me any questions about PornViewer.

#### Is there a safe-for-work version of this?
No. You're welcome to fork this repo and make one. If you want my opinion I think you should call it
`lolphotos`.

#### What's next for PornViewer?
So glad I asked.
 * drag-n-drop file and folder management
 * fake directories called Collections
 * view images from multiple directories or Collections
 * "cascade view"
 * video files


## Building PornViewer
You're going to need [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) and the npm thingy it comes with. Linux users are
advised to **always** install Node.js from source. If you're on Windows, you will need MinGW. I
recommend just using the lovely [command-line git installer](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Clone this repository and download the most recent stable version of [node-webkit](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js#downloads).
Unzip it, put it in the repository directory and rename it `nw`. If you're building a windows msi,
copy the contents of the `nw` directory into `resources\x64\` or `resources\x86\`.

Then do this stuff:
```shell
cd PornViewer
npm install
cd src
npm install
npm install -g nw-gyp
cd node_modules/lwip
nw-gyp clean
nw-gyp configure --msvs_version=2013 --target=0.12.3
# nw-gyp configure --msvs_version=2013 --target=0.12.3 --arch=ia32
nw-gyp build
# nw-gyp build --arch=ia32
cd ../../
gulp once
```

Finally, use either `launch.sh` or `launch.vbs` to start the application. There is a shitton of
unnecessary content left in the `lwip` build and some of the other npm modules as well. Tracking
down and eliminating everything you don't need will drastically improve application launch time.
Remember to `gulp once` after making changes, or simply `gulp` to start a watch-and-rebuild process.

#### Building an MSI
I can't get `copy \b` to work right, maybe it's win10? So I use mingw's `cat` to make the prepacked
executable. Substitute `x86` if you need it.
```shell
cat resources/x64/nw.exe package.zip > build/x64/nw.exe
```

You'll need [WiX](http://wixtoolset.org/). Use a DOS shell to run `winbuild.bat`. This will build
one or two `.msi` files in `build\` depending on which architecture(s) have been prepared
completely.
